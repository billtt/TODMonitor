TOD Monitor for Fenix A320

This is a simple script that monitors the distance to TOD and play alert sound when distance is below a certain threshold.
It's for my personal use so there are several parameters hard-coded. If anyone wants to use this script please leave a comment and I will make them configurable.

Needs to leave the pilot's MCDU screen at PERF / CRZ page for this script to work.
